# Expert Council Bot

## Project Motivations

We want to know what Person _x_ would say about _y_ or how they might answer question _z_

## User Flow

1. prompt user
> "What is the most important part about neural networks" 
2. The model would find what the expert would reply to this. 
4. The model returns what it finds as the best answer, and the original source of the data.  

## Constructing an "Expert" Council Member
Get raw audio content of the person speaking, correctly labeled. 
Label the objects in our corpus 



## Features:

**1. Most Relevant Content from an Expert on Prompt's Subject Matter.

**2. Evolution on prompt's subject matter** 
Metadata from YouTube link (original audio source) to get the upload date. 

If "neural network" comes up, we know when the expert's stance or mentioning of this 


## What Could Be Done In The Future 

1. Expand database to more content from multiple platforms and appearances of each expert, and adding more experts. 

This requires **speaker segmentation** on the raw audio file, labeling the expert, and capturing the relevant meta data from the audio source. 
Building out a pipeline from other audio/video sources than just YouTube monologues.
