    "description": "When a very young child looks at a picture, she can identify simple elements: \"cat,\" \"book,\" \"chair.\" Now, computers are getting smart enough to do that too. What's next? In a thrilling talk, computer vision expert Fei-Fei Li describes the state of the art \u2014 including the database of 15 million photos her team built to \"teach\" a computer to understand pictures \u2014 and the key insights yet to come.\n\nTEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).

    "description": "In this session (https://scl.ai/3EaRje9), Dr. Li shares how vision is critical for first perceiving the physical world and then interacting with it. She explores how recent advances in AI research help machines perceive the environment around them and then engages with it, to perform both short-horizon and long-horizon tasks.\n\nExecutive summary: Teaching Robots To Perform Complex Tasks - https://scl.ai/3lu2lnn\nFull discussion transcript -  https://scl.ai/3EaRje9\n\nBio: Dr. Fei-Fei Li is the Sequoia Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and Denning Co-Director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI). Her research includes cognitively inspired AI, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and AI+healthcare. Before co-founding HAI, she served as Director of Stanford\u2019s AI Lab. During her Stanford sabbatical from 2017 - 2018, Dr. Li was a Vice President at Google and Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud.\n\nJoin the leading AI community full of leaders, visionaries, practitioners, and researchers.

    "title": "Fei-Fei Li - Where Did ImageNet Come From?",
    "description": "ImageNet has become one of the most influential visual datasets in the fields of Deep Learning and AI. More than 14 million photographs were gathered through a benchmarking effort that propelled the outbreak of Computer Vision and its wide range of applications such as surveillance, phone filters, medical imaging, biometry and autonomous cars. ImageNet is organised through 21,000 categories that are still being used today to train computational models. \n\nIn September 2019, ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li gave a talk at The Photographers' Gallery as part of a 10th anniversary of ImageNet party, talking through the events and key people that led to the datasets creation. The event also featured a series of activities and presentations to showcase the impact of ImageNet, including a discussion by Dr. Alan Blackwell and a performace on annotation by Nicolas Malev\u00e9.\n\nhttps://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/imagenetbirthday",

More than half of the human brain is involved in visual processing. The remarkable human visual system evolved over billions of years, but computer vision is one of the youngest disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
