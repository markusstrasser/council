  "text": " And the question is how complex is the range of possibilities that might happen in the driving task? Is that to you still an open problem of how difficult is driving? Like so softly speaking. All the time you work on driving, do you understand how hard driving is? Yeah, driving is really hard. Because it has to do with the predictions of all these other agents in the theory of mind and you know what they're going to do and are they looking at you or are they looking where are they thinking? Yeah, there's a lot that goes there at the full tail off. You know the expansion of the knives that we have to be comfortable with eventually the final problems are of that form. I don't think those are the problems that are very common. I think eventually they're important but it's like really in the tail end. In the tail end, the rare edge cases from the vision perspective, what are the toughest parts of the vision problem of driving? Well basically the sensor is extremely powerful but you still need to process that information. And so going from brightnesses of these special values to hey here the three dimensional world is extremely hard and that's what the neural networks are fundamentally doing. And so the difficulty really is in just doing an extremely good job of engineering the entire pipeline, the entire data engine, having the capacity to train these neural nets, having the ability to evaluate the system and iterate on it. So I would say just doing this in production at scale is like the hard part. It's an execution problem. So the data engine but also the sort of deployment of the system such that it has low latency performance so it has to do all these steps. For the neural nets specifically just making sure everything fits into the chip on the car. And you have a finite budget of flops that you can perform and memory bandwidth and other constraints and you have to make sure it flies. And you can squeeze in as much computers as you can into the tiny. What have you learned from that process because it may be that's one of the bigger like new things coming from a research background where there's a system that has to run under heavily constrained resources that's around really fast. What kind of insights have you learned from that? I'm not sure if there's too many insights you're trying to create a neural net that will fit in what you have available and you're always trying to optimize it. And we talked a lot about it on the AI day and basically the triple backflips that the team is doing to make sure it all fits and utilizes the engine. So I think it's extremely good engineering. And then there's all kinds of little insights that are done on how to do it properly.",
